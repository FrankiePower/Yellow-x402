# Yellow Network Hackathon Strategy

## Goal
To build a high-performance dApp that leverages the Yellow Network (Nitrolite) state channel technology to solve real-world problems requiring speed, scalability, and low costs.

## Prizes & Incentives
Based on typical Yellow Network hackathon structures:
- **Top Prizes**: ~$5,000 - $10,000 Cash/Stablecoin.
- **Seed Funding**: Opportunities for up to $250k in investment for promising projects.
- **Incubation**: Direct access to Yellow Network team and mentorship.
- **Networking**: Exposure to industry leaders and potential showcase opportunities.

## Key Requirements
1. **Nitrolite SDK Integration**: Must implement `@erc7824/nitrolite` for state channel management.
2. **Working Demo**: A fully functional application demonstrating the core value proposition.
3. **Yellow Network Technology**:
   - Use of State Channels for off-chain transactions.
   - Integration with ClearNode/Yellow Network infrastructure.
   - innovative use of "Layer-3" cross-chain capabilities.
4. **Open Source**: Codebase must be public.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Technical Implementation**: Quality of code and correct use of the SDK.
- **Innovation**: efficient use of state channels (e.g., streaming payments, HFT).
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration of complex tech (e.g., fallback mechanisms).
- **Practicality**: Real-world viability of the solution.

## Project Ideas
Focus on domains where *instant finality* and *low fees* are critical:
1. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Order book matching off-chain.
2. **Pay-Per-Use Services**:
   - Video Streaming (like the reference project).
   - API metering (micro-payments per call).
   - Wi-Fi/Data sharing.
3. **Gaming**: Real-time betting or in-game asset trading without latency.
4. **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Instant P2P settlements.
